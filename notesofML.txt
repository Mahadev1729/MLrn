Types of ML Technique:

-- Supervised Machine Learning
-- Unsupervised Machine Learning
-- Reinforcemnet Machine Learning


# Simple linear Regression
  -- try to find the best fit line to predict the output for the new input
  
# Multiple Linear Regression

  -- used to estimate the Realtionship between two or more independent variables and dependent variables 


Performance matrix

1. R square:it effects the ouput feature with corrrelation with the input feature

2. adjusted R square:
    to solve above introduce the adjuste R square


#MSE{mean square error}



# underfitting vs overfitting model

 
if I have a dataset which contain 1000 features :
   a.in that 700 features for training
   b.in that 300 features for test
